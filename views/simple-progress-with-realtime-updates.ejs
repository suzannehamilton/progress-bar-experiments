<p>This example uses the HTML progress element and the ARIA status and alert roles to inform users of commencement, progress and completion </p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This is simple carrot cooking app. Click the button to begin..
    <button>Start cooking</button>
<p>
    <label for="carrots">Carrot cooking progress <span aria-hidden="true" id="visible-status"></span><span role="status" id="approximate-status"></span></label>
    <progress id="carrots" max="100" value="0">0%</progress>
</p>

<div role="alert" id="complete"></div>

<h2>Notes on this approach</h2>
<p>These are some of the things to note from the VoiceOver perspective:</p>
<ul>
    <li>✅ Using the progress HTML element means changes are exposed to the accessibility API for free</li>
    <li>✅ Notifies users of commencement</li>
    <li>✅ Notifies users of progress status (perhaps a bit much? Could be debounced maybe)</li>
    <li>✅ Notifies users of completion</li>
    <li>❌ We're not doing anything to manage the button after it's been clicked. It stays there but is not functional. That would need to be fixed.</li>
    <li>❌ In some circumstances I'm encountering a race condition because the alert role is more assertive than status</li>
    <li>❓ Would it be better to manage the user focus so that they are moved to an appropriate place on completion?</li>
</ul>
